## Problem Set 1- DNA Ecryption 

* The `encrypt` function takes a plaintext string of text and returns an encrypted message in the form of
  a dictionary using the `encryptionkey` 
* The `decrypt` function takes the encrypted message and returns the plaintext message. 

## Collaborators

* I had no collaborators on PSet 1. I completed all of the work on my own, with a few clarifying syntax-related questions I asked other students in the class.
