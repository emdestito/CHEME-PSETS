## Collaborators: Emily, Liam, and Anthony
* We all disucssed and worked through all parts of the problem set together, and Emily typed up our ideas. We also discussed certain aspects with other groups when we got stuck, such as for editing the solvers file where we consulted with Jake.

## UPDATE
* The error with case 1 was due to our factory file. We had an error within our for loop for the _build_system_matrix function.
